# The TanakhCC guide
This is the default starting point for people new to TanakhCC.
Feel free to contribute, by improving the documentation or fixing typos and the like.

Please keep the explanation short and readable for people that are just starting out.
Advanced material belongs in an Appendix or in specially marked chapters at the end of a specific section.

# Translating the guide
Any help in translating this guide into as many languages as possible is greatly appreciated!
To get started, clone this repository, copy the `en/` folder.
Edit the metadata in `book.toml` and start translating.
In the end, add your languages shorthand (must be the name of the new folder you created) to `./languages`.
