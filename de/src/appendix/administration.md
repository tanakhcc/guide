## When to approve Reconciliations
Please **always be gracious** for the effor of transcribers and reconcilers who volunteer their time.
Seriously listen to their opinions and take time to write friendly and understandable replies.
Your job when approving merge requests for reconciliations is not to retranscribe the page, or to take a lot of your time to rething problems that 3 or more people have tackeled before.
Your goals during the approving of a merge request are:
- Catch **gross errors**. These can be assumed to not exist in places without differences between transcriptions.
- Answer uncertainties of transcribers and reconcilers.
- Decide in situations where opinions of transcribers and reconcilers is closely (or even 1:1) set against each other.

If you do not see obvious problems with the proposed transcription, there are no open questions about the page being merged, simply scan through places where there is dissent between transcribers and the reconciler.
Decide in these questionable cases, ask if anyone feels the need to discuss your choice and **close the merge request a few days later**.
To retain volunteer motivation, it is important to keep the feedback cycle quick.

When needed, changes to the proposed final XML can be made directly in gitlab (or copy-paste the data into your own text editor and change it there).
When finished, add the change as a new commit in the merge request.

- If the reconciler has chosen the *majority view* amongst transcribers, only seek clarification if you have serious doubts about that reconstruction.
- If the reconciler chose a *minority view* or the split between transcribers was even, check that passage for yourself.
  Err on the side of the reconciler in that case - they already spent time sifting through the same problem you are looking at right now.
- If the reconciler chose a *completely unique solution* to a passage, please carefully check it against the pages original image.
  Err on the side of the transcribers, if a majority exists there.

If you are also uncertain how to deal with a passage, feel free to **tag more project maintainers** and get another opinion.

## TODO - Adding MSs
You can add Manuscripts via the [`Administer` page of critic](https://critic.tanakhcc.org/admin).

## TODO - About Page Image Copyright
It is VERY important that all images uploaded to critic may actually be used in that way.
Make sure that the copyright on the image permits our use of it, and attribute the image source if required by the license.

## TODO - How Versification schemes are reconciled
