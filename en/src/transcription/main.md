# Transcribing

## What makes a good transcription?
TODO - reconstruct the original
NO EDITORIAL OPINION IN TRANSCRIPTIONS

## How to start?
First of, head over to [critic.tanakhcc.org](https://critic.tanakhcc.org).
You will be redirected to a login page where you need to create an account when you first visit.
Create an account or log in to use critic.

You can find manuscript pages to transcribe in [a neat list](https://critic.tanakhcc.org/transcribe) in critic.
You will find some stats about the page in question, such as the contained verses, or how many transcriptions have already been started and finished for this page.
Simply click on the page row and you will be taken to the transcription editor and can check out the page image itself.

Here is how you can select a page that is right for you to get started:
Look at a few ones (perhaps choose one with your favorite verse to start), choose one that looks good to you and where you do not have much trouble reading the handwriting.
If you choose a manuscript that already has one or two other transcriptions, that increases the chance that your transcription might become part of TanakhCCs official data quite quickly.
Seeing your work pay off is motivating, so consider choosing manuscripts someone else has already transcribed - especially for your first few pages.

## Using the Transcription Editor
(TODO:) Link to github issue exists, which automatically starts the issue with the correct links and tags.

TODO - big section
What you will do here
Shortcuts
Go over all the different blocks
Go over semantics while we do this - will mirror content from the TEI spec

## Publish your transcription
Once you are satisifed with your transcription, publish it by pressing the ... publish button at the bottom right of the transcription editor.
This will allow others to see your transcription when reconciling and moves your work into the next phase of preparation before it will join TanakhCC.

Now you have already transcribed your first page.
Thank you for your hard work, your time and effort spent contributing to TanakhCC.
Your dedication helps provide free access to Gods word - accurately and in a modern format.

You may continue by transcribing another page right now!
Once you have completed (TODO - how many???) transcriptions, you will become eligible to also reconcile transcriptions, which is described [later in this guide](reconciling.html).
